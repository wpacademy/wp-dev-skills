# WordPress AI Agent Skills

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for professional WordPress development. These skills ensure your AI coding agent — whether it's Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, GitHub Copilot, Codex, or any other — follows official WordPress coding standards, security best practices, accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA), and WordPress.org directory guidelines when building plugins and themes, or reviewing existing plugins for security vulnerabilities and repository readiness.

## 🎯 What Are Agent Skills?

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) are an **open standard** for extending AI agents with specialized capabilities. A skill is simply a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file (with YAML frontmatter + instructions) and optional supporting files like `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/`.

All major AI coding tools now support the same skills format natively:

|Tool              |Project Skills Location|Global Skills Location         |Docs                                                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|**Antigravity**   |`.agent/skills/`       |`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`|[docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/skills)                               |
|**GitHub Copilot**|`.github/skills/`      |`~/.copilot/skills/`           |[docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills)|
|**Codex (OpenAI)**|`.codex/skills/`       |`~/.codex/skills/`             |[docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills)                           |

**Write once, use everywhere.** Skills you create for one tool work across all tools that support the standard.

## 📦 Included Skills

### 1. `wp-plugin-dev` — WordPress Plugin Development

Guides your AI agent to build production-ready WordPress plugins with proper architecture and security.

**Triggers when you say things like:**

- “Build me a plugin for X”
- “Create a WordPress plugin”
- “I need a WooCommerce extension”
- “Add a REST API endpoint”

**What it enforces:**

- **Clean bootstrap** — Main plugin file contains only constants, hooks, and autoloading. No feature logic.
- **Modular architecture** — Every feature gets its own class file (`includes/`, `admin/`, `public/`, `api/`)
- **Security** — Mandatory `sanitize_*()` on all input, `esc_*()` on all output, `$wpdb->prepare()` for all SQL, nonces on all forms, capability checks on all privileged actions
- **Caching** — Transients API and `wp_cache_*` for expensive operations
- **WordPress.org compliance** — GPL licensing, `readme.txt`, `uninstall.php`, proper prefixing, translatable strings

**Supported plugin types:**

|Type                                 |Boilerplate Included|
|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
|Standard (settings, CPTs, shortcodes)|✅                   |
|WooCommerce extensions               |✅                   |
|Gutenberg block plugins              |✅                   |
|REST API / headless plugins          |✅                   |
|AJAX handlers                        |✅                   |
|Custom database tables               |✅                   |

### 2. `wp-plugin-review` — WordPress Plugin Review

Guides your AI agent to perform a comprehensive code review of any WordPress plugin, combining automated tooling with deep manual analysis.

**Triggers when you say things like:**

- "Review this plugin"
- "Audit a WordPress plugin"
- "Check plugin security"
- "Check my plugin for repository submission"
- "Plugin code review"

**What it does:**

- **Two-phase review** — Runs automated tools (PHPCS with WPCS, PHPStan, PHPUnit) followed by deep manual code inspection
- **Security audit** — Checks input sanitization, output escaping, SQL injection, nonce verification, capability checks, file security, and external request handling
- **Coding standards** — Validates naming conventions, hook usage, enqueuing, internationalization, and PHP compatibility
- **Repository readiness** — Verifies readme.txt, plugin headers, licensing, prefixing, data/privacy compliance, and admin UX
- **Unit test assessment** — Evaluates test existence, quality, coverage areas, and CI/CD readiness
- **Accessibility review** — Checks ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast, screen reader support, and semantic HTML

**Report output:**

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability or blocking issue — must fix |
| HIGH | Significant issue — may cause repository rejection |
| MEDIUM | Best practice violation — recommended fix |
| LOW | Minor improvement — nice to have |
| PASS | Area passes review |

The final report includes an overall score out of 100, per-category scores, before/after code fix snippets, and a priority-ordered list of recommended fixes.

### 3. `wp-theme-dev` — WordPress Theme Development

Guides your AI agent to build accessible, standards-compliant WordPress themes.

**Triggers when you say things like:**

- “Build me a theme for X”
- “Create a block theme”
- “I need a classic WordPress theme”
- “Make a child theme”

**What it enforces:**

- **Block themes as default** — Full Site Editing with `theme.json`, HTML templates, block patterns, style variations
- **Classic theme support** — Template hierarchy, The Loop, Customizer API when requested
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)** — Skip links, keyboard navigation, visible focus indicators, ARIA landmarks, 4.5:1 color contrast, underlined content links, proper heading hierarchy, screen-reader-text, reduced motion support
- **Modern CSS** — Custom properties, Grid/Flexbox, `clamp()` fluid typography, logical properties for RTL
- **WordPress.org compliance** — All 14 review categories, no plugin territory, proper licensing, `readme.txt` with resource credits

**Supported theme types:**

|Type              |Boilerplate Included|
|------------------|--------------------|
|Block themes (FSE)|✅                   |

> **💡 Tip:** Since all platforms now follow the same Agent Skills standard, the skill folders are 100% portable. No conversion needed — just copy and use.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Plugin Development

```
Build me a WordPress plugin called "Smart Reviews" that adds a custom
post type for reviews with star ratings, a REST API endpoint to fetch
reviews, and a Gutenberg block to display them.
```

Your AI agent will automatically:

- Scaffold a clean, modular plugin structure
- Keep the main file as a bootstrap loader only
- Create separate class files for the CPT, REST API, and block
- Sanitize all input, escape all output, use `$wpdb->prepare()`
- Generate `readme.txt` and `uninstall.php`

### Plugin Review

```
Review my "Smart Reviews" plugin for security issues, coding standards
compliance, and WordPress.org repository readiness. Generate a full report.
```

Your AI agent will automatically:

- Install and run PHPCS (with WordPress Coding Standards), PHPStan, and PHPUnit
- Perform a deep manual review of security patterns, coding standards, and repository guidelines
- Check accessibility of any admin UI components
- Evaluate unit test coverage and quality
- Generate a detailed Markdown report with severity ratings, before/after code fixes, and an overall score out of 100

### Theme Development

```
Create a block theme called "Starter Blue" with a hero section,
blog archive, and dark mode style variation. Make it accessibility-ready.
```

Your AI agent will automatically:

- Generate `theme.json` with accessible color palette (4.5:1+ contrast)
- Create HTML templates with proper semantic structure
- Add skip links, ARIA landmarks, underlined content links
- Include keyboard-navigable mobile menu with `aria-expanded`
- Build block patterns with translatable strings
- Generate `readme.txt` with resource credits
